I‚Äôm Dhanushree, a Technical Program Manager with 4+ years of experience driving cloud, data, and AI projects across AWS, Snowflake, and GCP. I graduated in December and recently started at NSP Systems, where I lead platform modernization initiatives. Beyond my day-to-day role, I actively work on personal projects, including building AI agents that automate workflows, keeping me on the cutting edge of emerging technologies. My background spans both technical delivery and stakeholder management, so I enjoy bridging strategy with execution.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm a classical dancer, a big foodie who loves cooking, and a proud dog lover üê∂‚Äîall of which keep me creative, balanced, and energized.
